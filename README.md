 ## [Maximum Path Sum 1](https://github.com/Mike4847/Project-Euler/tree/main/maximum%20Sum%20I)
[_18_ ]
> "The idea is you have been provided with a triangular matrix of Data.
  And youre only allowed to move to the adjacent cells below from the top row.
  whats the  maximu path form the top to the base.
  _*DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING AT IT FINEST..
  ENJOY!!*_ "

 ## [Counting Sundays](https://github.com/Mike4847/Project-Euler/tree/main/CountSundays)
 [_19_]
> "In this program the idea is calculating the number of sundays that have been the 1st of a month 
  over a centuary 1901 - 2000. The idea is youre given starting date of jan 1st 1900 to be a monday.
  1900 being not a leap year 365 days to 1st jan 1901 which was a tuesday"

 ## [Name Score](https://github.com/Mike4847/Project-Euler/tree/main/Names%20Score)
 [_21_]
 > "The idea is sorting the names strings alphabetically(lexiographically),
 of course this brings the question which sorting algorithm is effecient. 
 We consider those algorithm that are stable and stability is achieved when equal keys/entries maintain their "original" Order"

 ## [Non-Abundant sum](https://github.com/Mike4847/Project-Euler/tree/main/Non-Abundant%Sum)
 [_22_]
 >" The problem wishes to solve sum of all pisitive integers upto some limit,
  the catch is this numbers should not be a sum of abundant number.
  A number is Abundant if the sum of its perfect divisor exceeds the number."
